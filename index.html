            This page is a tribute to the great psychological thinker Dr. Carl Gustav Jung. Born <strong>July 26<sup>th</sup> 1875</strong>,
            and died on <strong>June 6<sup>th</sup> 1961 </strong>at age <strong>85.</strong>
            Jung was an important and influential figure in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, 
            and helped the western world grapple with the psychological analysis 
            of the individual.Many of his ideas had genesis in the thought 
            of his mentor, but Jung would find himself at odds with his teacher, 
            and so the setting for Jung to delve into his own exploration of 
            psychology would be set from this.  A student of the famous Sigmund Freud, 
            Jung would take many of Freud's ideas and investigate them arguably
            much farther than his mentor. Jung argued that the human being is not the master of one’s own house. 
            That is to say, there are forces that compel one unconsciously.Unlike Freud however, Jung was skeptical that
            human motivations were purely a consequence of sexual drive. Jung suggests it is only through a process called individuation, 
            that one can attain the highest version of themselves. It is through the integration of one’s own unconscious 
            psychic energies that one reaches what Jung called the God Image. Jung drew upon his eclectic knowledge of 
            Philosophy, Psychology, Theology, Myths, Astrology, Alchemy, and many other fields to come to this conclusion. 
            This would be the groundwork for what is commonly referred to in modern Psychoanalysis as Jungian analysis. 
            This method and breakdown of Psychoanalysis is divided as Follows:

            <h4>The Ego</h4>
            This element of the psyche represents
        one’s own conscious mind. Everything that 
        keeps track of one’s own personal narrative
         and continuity is contained, as well as how 
         one identifies. Conscious emotion and memories 
         are also a part of this, but this is not the whole
          story as one will find out.

            <h4>The Persona</h4>
            This is the mask that one puts on for the world. 
            It is what allows us to be civilized in society 
            and the reason that society can even exist. 
            It is what sets expectation and lets us fill a role 
            that can be defined explicitly like Doctor, Lawyer, 
            Priest, ect. It hides our darker natures in 
            order to protect one’s own image.
