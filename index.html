            This page is a tribute to the great psychological thinker Dr. Carl Gustav Jung. Born <strong>July 26<sup>th</sup> 1875</strong>,
            and died on <strong>June 6<sup>th</sup> 1961 </strong>at age <strong>85.</strong>
            Jung was an important and influential figure in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, 
            and helped the western world grapple with the psychological analysis 
            of the individual.Many of his ideas had genesis in the thought 
            of his mentor, but Jung would find himself at odds with his teacher, 
            and so the setting for Jung to delve into his own exploration of 
            psychology would be set from this.  A student of the famous Sigmund Freud, 
            Jung would take many of Freud's ideas and investigate them arguably
            much farther than his mentor. Jung argued that the human being is not the master of one’s own house. 
            That is to say, there are forces that compel one unconsciously.Unlike Freud however, Jung was skeptical that
            human motivations were purely a consequence of sexual drive. Jung suggests it is only through a process called individuation, 
            that one can attain the highest version of themselves. It is through the integration of one’s own unconscious 
            psychic energies that one reaches what Jung called the God Image. Jung drew upon his eclectic knowledge of 
            Philosophy, Psychology, Theology, Myths, Astrology, Alchemy, and many other fields to come to this conclusion. 
            This would be the groundwork for what is commonly referred to in modern Psychoanalysis as Jungian analysis. 
            This method and breakdown of Psychoanalysis is divided as Follows:

        <div class="container">
        <div>
            <h4>The Ego</h4>
            This element of the psyche represents
        one’s own conscious mind. Everything that 
        keeps track of one’s own personal narrative
         and continuity is contained, as well as how 
         one identifies. Conscious emotion and memories 
         are also a part of this, but this is not the whole
          story as one will find out.


        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Persona</h4>
            This is the mask that one puts on for the world. 
            It is what allows us to be civilized in society 
            and the reason that society can even exist. 
            It is what sets expectation and lets us fill a role 
            that can be defined explicitly like Doctor, Lawyer, 
            Priest, ect. It hides our darker natures in 
            order to protect one’s own image. 

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Shadow</h4>
            This element of the psyche represents all that one rejects within oneself. 
            It is all the negative and unexamined aspects housed within the unconscious. 
            The shadow can be projected outwards onto others in order to keep one’s ego 
            protected. It is the mirror that shows us what we don’t like about ourselves 
            so that perhaps one day we may face it. 

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Anima/Animus</h4>
            Jung posited that nested within the shadow there are manifestations of the opposite sex. 
            These were termed Anima (feminine side of a man) and Animus (masculine side of a female). 
            Each of these masculine and feminine energies are within oneself, and only by getting in touch 
            with one’s opposite could one understand themselves fully. 

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Individuation</h4>
            This is the process by which one integrates all that one has learned about oneself 
            through careful introspection. It is only when the ego, persona, shadow, and 
            Anima/Animus have been examined and integrated that one can finally reach their full 
            potential as a human being. 

        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Self</h4>
            Jung believed that the self was the ideal version of oneself. 
            The version that is one and the same with the spark of divinity or god image. 
            It is the reason that one seeks to improve instead of becoming bitter and 
            corrupt. Jung believed that the point of life was to complete individuation so 
            that the individual can stand against the masses while maintaining careful 
            attention to also be apart of humanity as a whole.
